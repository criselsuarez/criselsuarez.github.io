# Estimations of Elemental Abundances during Solar Flares Observed in Soft X-Rays by the MinXSS-1 CubeSat Mission
### Crisel Suarez and Christopher S. Moore

This page is a demo that shows everything you can do inside blog posts. Hi !

We’ve included everything you need to create engaging posts about your work, and show off your case studies in a beautiful way.

**Obviously,**we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options available in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add **blockquotes**, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”
