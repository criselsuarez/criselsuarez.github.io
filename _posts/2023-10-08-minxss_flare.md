# [Estimations of Elemental Abundances during Solar Flares Observed in Soft X-Rays by the MinXSS-1 CubeSat Mission](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acf0c2)

### Crisel Suarez and Christopher S. Moore

Solar flares are complex phenomena emitting all types of electromagnetic radiation and accelerating particles on timescales of minutes, converting magnetic energy to thermal, radiative, and kinetic energy through magnetic reconnections. As a result, local plasma can be heated to temperatures in excess of 20 MK. During the soft X-ray (SXR) solar flare peak, the elemental abundance of low first ionization potential elements are typically observed to be depleted from coronal values. We explored the abundance variations using disk-integrated solar spectra from the Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer CubeSat-1 (MinXSS-1). MinXSS-1 is sensitive to the 1â€“12 keV energy range with an effective 0.25 keV FWHM resolution at 5.9 keV. During the year-long mission of MinXSS-1, between 2016 May and 2017 May, 21 flares with intermittent data downlinks were observed ranging from C to M class. We examine the time evolution of temperature, volume emission measure, and elemental abundances of Fe, Ca, Si, S, and Ar with CHIANTI spectral models near the peak SXR emission times observed in the MinXSS-1 data. We determined the average absolute abundance of A(Fe) = 7.81, A(Ca) = 6.84, A(S) = 7.28, A(Si) = 7.90, and A(Ar) = 6.56. These abundances are depleted from coronal values during the SXR peak compared to nonflaring times. The elemental abundance values that are depleted from their coronal values are consistent with the process of chromospheric evaporation, in which the lower atmospheric plasma fills the coronal loops."
