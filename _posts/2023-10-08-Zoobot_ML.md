Zoobot is a Python package for measuring the detailed appearance of galaxies in telescope images using deep learning. Zoobot is aimed at astronomers who want to solve a galaxy image task such as finding merging galaxies or counting spiral arms. Astronomers can use Zoobot to adapt (finetune) pretrained deep learning models to solve their task. These finetuned models perform better and require far fewer new labels than training from scratch.
